# nand2tetris project files

My assignment solutions for the course [nand2tetris Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). In the course, you learn a basic overview of process of creating
a computer from the ground up. Each folder 00,01,02 corresponds with the week of the assignment, e.g /01 is for Week 1.

## Reminder to self: assignments done in each week

#### Week 1 /01
Given implementation of an NAND gate, build a bunch of other logic gates in a simplified version of HDL.

#### Week 2 /02
Write more logic gates that are used to implement the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), such as the HalfAdder.

#### Week 3 /03
Given implementation of a D Flip Flop, build a bunch of other (memory-based) logic gates like registers.

#### Week 4 /04
Write 2 simple programs in the Hack assembly language

#### Week 5 /05
Build an implementation of a memory unit and CPU using logic gates built in previous weeks.

#### Week 6 /06
Write an assembler to translate Hack assembly language code into Hack machine language code. (Python)

#### Week 7 /07
Write a simple compiler to translate Hack VM code into Hack assembly language. Includes basic 
functionality such as arithmetic, push and pop operations. (Python)

#### Week 8 /08
Write a more complicated compiler, extended from Week 7's to translate Hack VM code into Hack assembly language. Includes additional functionality such as flow branching and functions. (Python)

#### Week 9 /09
Write a simple program using the Jack programming language. Built a simple platformer movement system
( jumping with gravity ). (Python)

#### Week 10 /10
Write the syntax analyzer for a compiler to compile from Hack .Jack code into the Hack VM Language. Includes a tokenizer and parser. Also learnt my lesson from Week 7/8 and decided to do it using OOP
principles instead of chaining a bunch of functions. (Python)
